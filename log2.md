# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Daily Log Below

### Day 0: 14 June 2020

**Today's Progress**: From tomorrow onwards, for next 100 days, I commit to do 2 hours study (5 Pomodoros) of Data Science related topics (Python, R, Statistics, ML etc) and then post progress here.

**Thoughts**: I have been studying DS on and off for past 3 months. But haven't been able to put my body mind and soul to it. It's time to quit this amateurish stance and really start learning. I have tried this challenge thrice earlier but failed. Hope I am successful this time. I also understand that this is not really the main aim of this challenge (100 days of *code*). But if I am able to study at least 2 hours daily for next 100 days, then I will have the amount of knowledge to do *code* challenge for next 100 days. If you are reading this, wish me luck!

### Day 1: 15 June 2020

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am - 9.30 am (7.5 hours)
* **Work Start/Finish** : 11 am - 11 pm (12 Hours)
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 3 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Studying the Udemy Tutorials - Python zero to hero from Jose Portilla. Did Python Statements and Functions along with exercises.

**Thoughts**: I know tutorials don't count here, but still I want to learn Python so be it. Then only Python Practice and ML learnng. Let's go!

### Day 2: 16 June 2020

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am - 9.30 am (7.5 hours)
* **Work Start/Finish** : 10.30 am - 12 am (13.5 Hours)
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Took whole day but creted a Tic Tac Toe Game version all by myself (in fact 2 different versions). Pat on the back!

**Thoughts**: While not sure what I really learned from it, but it was definitely a challenge. I also learned a few vscode tricks. Even debugged my first program in Python. So that's a big plus. But, now let's also starting ML from tomorrow onwards. Hope it's a great journey overall.

But I also want to mention that I am not able to make the balance between Work and Rest/Home. Not really able to follow the plans that I am making in the calendar. It was probably only 50% today. I must stop work at a designated time and give time to my family or otherwise everyone is gonna suffer.

### Day 3: 21 June 2020

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am - 8.30 am (6.5 hours)
* **Work Start/Finish** : 1.30 pm - 12 am (10.5 hours)
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 3 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Exceptions, Linting and Unit Testing in Python

**Thoughts**: Ideally I should restart this log once more. But I am fed up of restarting this again and again. So I will continue to write in this log now for next 100 days even though its fractured. The idea is to complete 100 days of trying this before doing it for 100 **consecutive** days.

### Day 4: 22 June 2020

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2.15 am - 9.15 am (7 Hours)
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am - 12 am (15.5 Hours)
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 0 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Studied Generators and Decorators in Python.

**Thoughts**: Whole day was busy in office work but still made time to learn a little bit of Python. Just about half of what I had planned yesterday, but it still counts.

### Day 5:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 Pomodoros for Stats (Studied Hypothesis testing formulae). Also studied quite a bit extra but didn't time that through pomodoro today.

**Thoughts**: While making fairly good progress, I feel that I am just palying catchup by starting later in the day and thus having to study at the end of the day quite late at night sometimes. I will try to start earliy fromo tomorrow. Let's see how it goes.

### Day 6:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Did only 2 Pomodors today but overall studied Stats for over 2 hours (Practiced Hypothesis Testing Numericals).

**Thoughts**: Pomodoro fatigue seems to be setting in. The novelty is wearing off, so I must double down from tomorrow.

### Day 7:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Today was a disappointment just couldn't study anyting today.

**Thoughts**: Just felt tired throught the day but I am not letting that be my 'break' in this chain. I will be back tomorrow stronger.

### Day 8:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed 5 Pomodoros worth of learning Tableau. Tableau seems interesting but I have just scratched the surface it seems.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't that great a day because I had higher expectation but I will still take it because it was better than yesterday and I completed what's expected of me the least. Will try better tomorrow.

### Day 9:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Only studied for 1 Pomodoro about Tableau.

**Thoughts**: Really disappointed. Have decided to reset this streak and start from Day 1 tomorrow.

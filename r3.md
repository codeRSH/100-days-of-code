## Daily Log Below

### Day 0: 04/05/2025

**Thoughts**:

### Day 1: 5 May 20205

**Pomodoros Completed** : 2 (30 Mins each)

Today's Progress\*\*: Studying the Udemy Tutorials - Complete JavaScript Course from Jonas Schmedtmann. Completed Section 1.

**Thoughts**: I know tutorials don't count here, but still I want to learn JS, HTML5, CSS and then eventually UI5 from grown-up, so be it. I want to learn these technologies to make a better website. So let's go.

### Day 2: 6 May 2025

### Day 3: 7 May 2025

**Pomodoros Completed** : 3 (30 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 4, 5, 6 of the Course.

**Thoughts**: Although I made some progress again today, but it's coming at the cost of other office work which is not ideal. The internal and external distractions and interruptions are not making me go further. Need to be more proactive.

### Day 4: 8 May 2025

**Pomodoros Completed** : 0 (30 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Studied Generators and Decorators in Python.

**Thoughts**: Whole day was busy in office work but still made time to learn a little bit of Python. Just about half of what I had planned yesterday, but it still counts.

### Day 5: 9 May 2025

**Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (30 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 Pomodoros for Stats (Studied Hypothesis testing formulae). Also studied quite a bit extra but didn't time that through pomodoro today.

**Thoughts**: While making fairly good progress, I feel that I am just palying catchup by starting later in the day and thus having to study at the end of the day quite late at night sometimes. I will try to start earliy fromo tomorrow. Let's see how it goes.

### Day 6: 10 May 2025

**Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (30 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Did only 2 Pomodors today but overall studied Stats for over 2 hours (Practiced Hypothesis Testing Numericals).

**Thoughts**: Pomodoro fatigue seems to be setting in. The novelty is wearing off, so I must double down from tomorrow.

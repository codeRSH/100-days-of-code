**Today's Progress**: Learned about the steps to design Website. And also started Omnifood project by following the Tutorial.

### Day 5:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 Pomodoros for Stats (Studied Hypothesis testing formulae). Also studied quite a bit extra but didn't time that through pomodoro today.

**Thoughts**: While making fairly good progress, I feel that I am just palying catchup by starting later in the day and thus having to study at the end of the day quite late at night sometimes. I will try to start earliy fromo tomorrow. Let's see how it goes.

### Day 6:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Did only 2 Pomodors today but overall studied Stats for over 2 hours (Practiced Hypothesis Testing Numericals).

**Thoughts**: Pomodoro fatigue seems to be setting in. The novelty is wearing off, so I must double down from tomorrow.

### Day 7:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Today was a disappointment just couldn't study anyting today.

**Thoughts**: Just felt tired throught the day but I am not letting that be my 'break' in this chain. I will be back tomorrow stronger.

### Day 8:

* **Sleep/Wake**: 2 am
* **Work Start/Finish** : 9.30 am
* **Pomodoros Completed** : 4 (40 Mins each)

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed 5 Pomodoros worth of learning Tableau. Tableau seems interesting but I have just scratched the surface it seems.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't that great a day because I had higher expectation but I will still take it because it was better than yesterday and I completed what's expected of me the least. Will try better tomorrow.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Daily Log Below

### Day 0: 26 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: From tomorrow onwards, for next 100 days, I commit to do 2 hours study (5 Pomodoros) of Data Science related topics (Python, R, Statistics, ML etc) and then post progress here.

**Thoughts**: I have been studying DS on and off for past 2 months. But haven't been able to put my body mind and soul to it. It's time to quit this amateurish stance and really start learning. I have tried this challenge twice earlier but failed, hope I am successful this time. I also understand that this is not really the main aim of this challenge (100 days of *code*). But if I am able to study at least 2 hours daily for next 100 days, then I will have the amount of knowledge to do *code* challenge for next 100 days. If you are reading this, wish me luck!

### Day 1: 27 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: Beside Data Science, I am also I'm learning git through [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) site. Have completed till Lab 30 today. And of Data Science I complete only 1 Chapter from OpenStax Business Statistics books (it's free download). Less than what I expected, but I will still make it count.

**Thoughts**: I know tutorials don't count here, but still I want to learn git so be it. And it's a short tutorial so hopefully we will be done in a week. And regarding the statistics, I resolve even more to study at least 2 hours. Let's go!

### Day 2: 28 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: I studied about Probability (Conditional probability, Venn Diagram, Probability Distribution etc.). I also practiced numericals on paper and on Excel. Spent total 10 Pomodoros on Studay today. Spent additional 1 Pomodoro on Learning Git. Hopefully will complete that by this weekend. Already have next 'side project learning' ready.

**Thoughts**: The part of updating the notes along with studying did slow me down. I am not sure if that's the correct approach to learn. May be will change tactics in coming days if required. Feeling tired after studying for 10 Pomodors. Hopefully will get used to long hours of continous focus.

### Day 3: 29 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Central Limit Theorem and some other theorem about the Discreet and Continuous Distributions. Used 7 Pomodors along with 1 Pomodoro to learn Git.

**Thoughts**: Not as fantastic as yesterday but I can be excused for not being able to concentrate fully today due to anniversary and one of my favorite actors dying. It was just a roller coaster of emotions I had to experience today.

### Day 4: 30 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed 7 Pomodoros for Statitics (Studied Central Limit Theorem and Hypothesis Testing Theory ) along with 1 Pomodoro of Git. Git is finished.

**Thoughts**: Now that Git is finished, I will primarily focus on studying Statistics for next couple of days (may be just review Git a bit). Afterwards plan is to restart learning Python and finishing that tutorial.

### Day 5: 1 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed 5 Pomodoros for Stats (Studied Hypothesis testing formulae). Also studied quite a bit extra but didn't time that through pomodoro today.

**Thoughts**: While making fairly good progress, I feel that I am just palying catchup by starting later in the day and thus having to study at the end of the day quite late at night sometimes. I will try to start earliy fromo tomorrow. Let's see how it goes.

### Day 6: 2 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did only 2 Pomodors today but overall studied Stats for over 2 hours (Practiced Hypothesis Testing Numericals).

**Thoughts**: Pomodoro fatigue seems to be setting in. The novelty is wearing off, so I must double down from tomorrow.

### Day 7: 3 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was a disappointment just couldn't study anyting today.

**Thoughts**: Just felt tired throught the day but I am not letting that be my 'break' in this chain. I will be back tomorrow stronger.

### Day 8: 4 May 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I completed 5 Pomodoros worth of learning Tableau. Tableau seems interesting but I have just scratched the surface it seems.

**Thoughts**: Wasn't that great a day because I had higher expectation but I will still take it because it was better than yesterday and I completed what's expected of me the least. Will try better tomorrow.

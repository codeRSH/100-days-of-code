# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Daily Log Below

### Day 0: 26 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: From tomorrow onwards, for next 100 days, I commit to do 2 hours study (4 Pomodoros) of Data Science related topics (Python, R, Statistics, ML etc) and then post progress here.

**Thoughts**: I have been studying DS on and off for past 2 months. But haven't been able to put my body mind and soul to it. It's time to quit this amateurish stance and really start learning. I have tried this challenge twice earlier but failed, hope I am successful this time. I also understand that this is not really the main aim of this challenge (100 days of *code*). But if I am able to study at least 2 hours daily for next 100 days, then I will have the amount of knowledge to do *code* challenge for next 100 days. If you are reading this, wish me luck!

**Link to work:** I will be posting my progress at [Data Science](https://github.com/codeRSH/Data-Science )

### Day 1: 27 April 2020

**Today's Progress**: Beside Data Science, I am also I'm learning git through [Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) site. Have completed till Lab 30 today. And of Data Science I complete only 1 Chapter from OpenStax Business Statistics books (it's free download). Less than what I expected, but I will still make it count.

**Thoughts**: I know tutorials don't count here, but still I want to learn git so be it. And it's a short tutorial so hopefully we will be done in a week. And regarding the statistics, I resolve even more to study at least 2 hours. Let's go!
